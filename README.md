## Gym Rat

The aim of this project is to develop a 2D Platform in Unity. 
The player must progress through three levels in the game while avoiding 
and killing enemies, collecting protein shakes and making it to the gym equipment 
to finish the levels.

### Controls
Move : W/A/S/D or Arrow keys. 
Jump : Space. 
Attack : Tab. 
Pause : Escape. 

### Current Issues
Player does not stick to platforms as they move. Not a problem as this can be seen as a game mechanic.
Upgrade function in exchange for Protein Shakes not working. Makes Vendor scenes redundant until properly applied.
